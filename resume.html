                                                 <p>illy areas, drivers often cannot see oncoming traffic due to blind curves. This leads to the risk of accidents. The system proposed here uses infrared (IR) sensors to detect vehicles approaching from the opposite direction and controls traffic lights in real timeThis presentation introduces a real-time Traffic Management System designed to enhance road safety in such areas by automatically signaling drivers when to stop or move based on the data from sensors.<p>
